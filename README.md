## FAQ

#### Question 1
What's Flexbox and is it important?

#### Answer 1

* Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that we can use to create a row or a column axis layout. It makes our life easier to design and build responsive web pages without having to use tricky hacks and a lot of float and position properties in our CSS code.

#### Question 2
What is meant by Flexbox in CSS? 

#### Answer 2

* The flexbox or flexible box model in CSS is a one-dimensional layout model that has flexible and efficient layouts with distributed spaces among items to control their alignment structure ie., it is a layout model that provides an easy and clean way to arrange items within a container.

#### Question 3
What is a Grid 

#### Answer 3

* CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives. Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows.


#### Question 4
Is grid better than flexbox? 

#### Answer 4
* CSS Grid and Flexbox are layout models that share similarities and can even be used together. The main difference is that you can use CSS Grid to create two-dimensional layouts. In contrast, you can only use Flexbox to create one-dimensional layouts.
